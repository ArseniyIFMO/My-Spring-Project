This is my simple project
I made it to understand how Spring Boot works
You can add some notes here and then search in your notes

Initially, it worked on mySQL, but then I decided to switch database to H2 for making it easy to execute on every 
computer without creating specific database

I disabled security  because it doesnt work properly, also i switched db to H2
To run H2 console you should uncomment spring boot appliation settings in main, because H2 dont works with security

How to start:
    1)start application
    2) go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/
